I find very good online course.

### MLSS’14 Pittsburgh

Many concepts and formula are different from daily life. 

If I do not use them, I forget them quickly.

So everytime, I review those courses, I find they are new.

It is not fun if I need to finish my assignments.


Here are all the links they provided. http://www.textbooknova.com/ http://www.reddit.com/r/eebooks+mathbooks+csbooks+physicsbooks+econbooks/new/?sort=new http://bookboon.com/en/textbooks-ebooks http://textbookrevolution.org/index.php/Main_Page http://people.math.gatech.edu/~cain/textbooks/onlinebooks.html http://ebookee.org/ http://www.freebookspot.es/ http://www.free-ebooks.net/ http://www.getfreeebooks.com/ http://en.bookfi.org/ http://oerconsortium.org/discipline-specific/ http://www.gutenberg.org/
