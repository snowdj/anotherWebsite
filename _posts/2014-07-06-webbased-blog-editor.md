## A New Way to Write A Post

Prose.io provides a online editor for the gh-pages. It saves a lot of work to deal with the github.

I can write in any web browser. 

The editor even has a basic format tools, which is much better than editing in a txt editor like sublime2.

It is a good tool for blogger.

The problem is the meta data can not be saved. It is always blank, even I add something. 

Only if I also change the content, the meta data will change. 

Now it is not change again. Wired.
